  ## Description
  
  The purpose of this project is to be able to keep track of notes in one location. Not only should I be able to create functional notes, but also delete them when I am done with them, edit them as changes arise, and clear the form if I decide I no longer want to create a note. It's a very easy to use, simple application that is perfect for anyone who needs to keep track of notes in one location. The entirety of this application was built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as utilizing the Express.js framework.
